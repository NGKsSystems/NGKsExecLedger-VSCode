# NGKs ExecLedger Desktop Companion

This directory contains the interface specification and design documents for the NGKs ExecLedger desktop companion application.

## Overview

The desktop companion app provides PREMIUM tier users with enhanced access to artifacts artifacts and session data outside of VS Code. It reads the same disk outputs generated by the VS Code extension, ensuring a consistent source of truth.

## Interface Contract

The `interfaceSpec.json` file defines the stable API contract between the VS Code extension and the desktop companion app. This contract ensures:

- **Deterministic artifact location**: The extension and desktop app agree on where files are stored
- **Consistent data format**: Both consume the same JSON schemas for session data
- **Future compatibility**: Changes to the contract follow semantic versioning

## Key Principles

1. **Disk as Source of Truth**: The desktop app reads directly from artifacts bundle files, not through VS Code APIs
2. **No Duplication**: Uses the same retrieval logic and session selection rules as the extension
3. **Tier Enforcement**: Only PREMIUM users can access desktop companion features

## Development Status

- ✅ Interface specification defined
- 🚧 Desktop app UI/implementation (future phase)
- 🚧 PREMIUM tier validation (future phase)

## File Structure

```
desktop-companion/
├── interfaceSpec.json    # API contract definition
├── README.md            # This file
└── (future app files)   # Desktop app implementation
```

## Integration Points

The desktop companion integrates with the extension's artifacts system through:

- `_artifacts/bundles/latest.json` - Latest session pointer
- `_artifacts/bundles/integrity.json` - Optional integrity verification
- Session directories under `_artifacts/exec_*/milestone/*/`

See `interfaceSpec.json` for complete contract details.
