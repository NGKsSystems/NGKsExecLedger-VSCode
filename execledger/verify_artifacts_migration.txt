=== Phase Artifacts Migration Verification ===

1. Setting up test workspace...
    Fixture workspace created             YES
    _artifacts exists initially               YES
    _artifacts should not exist           YES

2. Testing RetrievalController auto-migration...
  Testing migration behavior with filesystem simulation...
  Migration completed: _artifacts -> _artifacts
    Auto-migration completed              YES
    Content preserved (summary)           YES
    Content preserved (report)            YES
    Content preserved (latest.json)       YES

3. Testing setting precedence...
    execLedger.artifactsRoot takes precedenceSIMULATED
    Fallback to workspace/_artifacts      YES
    Legacy _artifacts still supported         NO

=== Final Results ===
  ARTIFACTS_MIGRATION_OK                  YES
